## Introduction

I’m driven by a simple question: *“How does this system break — and how can I protect it?”*

With a background in Networking & IT Security, I’m deeply interested in understanding how systems operate, where they fail, and how to make them more secure and efficient. I love digging into the details — whether it’s analyzing logs, reverse engineering malware, or exploring how tools like QRadar and Snort surface hidden threats.

This portfolio isn't just a collection of labs and projects — it's also where I explore ideas and challenge assumptions. Sometimes I ask questions that don’t have clear answers yet, like whether MAC addresses are truly necessary for modern networking, or if there's a smarter, more efficient model waiting to be discovered.

I use this space to think out loud, reflect on what I’m learning, and share both technical experiments and conceptual “what ifs” as I grow.

This space reflects more than just what I do — it reflects how I think.  
This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a work in progress, just like me.

**Welcome to my journey.**
