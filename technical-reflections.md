# Technical Reflections

Welcome to my collection of technical reflections — a space where I share questions, thoughts, and ideas that come up as I explore cybersecurity, systems thinking, and how technology could evolve.

These posts aren’t just summaries of what I’ve learned — they’re notes on what I’m *curious* about. They reflect how I think through problems and look for better solutions.
