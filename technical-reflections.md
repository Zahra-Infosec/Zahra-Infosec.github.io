# Technical Reflections

Welcome to my collection of technical reflections â€” a space where I share questions, thoughts, and ideas that come up as I explore cybersecurity, systems thinking, and how technology could evolve.

These posts arenâ€™t just summaries of what Iâ€™ve learned â€” theyâ€™re notes on what Iâ€™m *curious* about. They reflect how I think through problems and look for better solutions.

Iâ€™ve also started writing technical reflections to explore the questions that donâ€™t always have clear answers.
